## ‚ú® Overview

Neenee is a next-generation, highly scalable Discord bot aimed at moderators, developers (and people who generally love bots!) to help them manage their server, perform moderation tasks (while listening to music) and just have fun in general while using Discord.

### üöÄ Features

- **Scalable** - Neenee is built with a fully modular architecture that allows you to add or remove parts as needed.
- **Robust** - The project relies on Python 3.12, the latest production version of the language.
- **Intuitive** - Neenee can be easily configured, unlike other bots, which rely on boring configuration guides.
- **Creative** - Ever feel like most bots on the platform have the same features? Neenee is here to change that. With every update, we aim to bring new and exciting features to the table.
- **Open-source** - Yeah, we absolutely <3 open source! Does that even need an explanation? :D

<br>

## üî® Setup

### Prerequisites

- [**Python 3.12**](https://python.org/) or higher
- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** for managing dependencies
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** for version control

### Installation

## üìù To-do List

- [x] Setup project structure with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [ ] Setup basic bot infrastructure:
    - [x] Implement core class for managing the bot (neenee/bot.py)
    - [x] Add CLI-based interface within (neenee/cli.py)
    - [ ] Create a custom credential manager for handling bot secrets (for now, will improve later)
    - [ ] Centralize console-based error messages
    - [ ] Prepare a setup guideline within README.md
- [ ] Add cogs / extensions:
    - [x] Prepare a basic `dev` cog for monitoring the bot while in development
    - [ ] Decentralize the cogs system so that it can be scalable as needed
    - [ ] Implement a `moderation` cog for server moderation commands
        - [x] Add basic moderation commands (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`, etc.)
        - [ ] Add advanced moderation commands (`/mute`, `/unmute`, `/warn`, etc.)
    - [ ] Implement a `general` cog for normal commands
- [x] Add advanced features (for now):
    - [x] Improve the logging system and centralize it for universal access
- [ ] Chore tasks:
    - [ ] Add interactive prompts / commands to CLI for easy setup
    - [ ] Add containerization
        - [ ] Add Docker as a build system for the bot
        - [ ] Introduce Docker Compose
